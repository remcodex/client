# RCE Client

Remote code execution client - this library uses [Guzwrap](https://github.com/Ahmard/guzwrap) to construct request and
then send it to
[RCE Server](https://github.com/remcodex/server). <br/>
[RCE Server](https://github.com/remcodex/server) will then perform the actual request and return the response to the
client.

## Notice ðŸ”Š

This project is currently receiving massive updates, which may include code refactoring, namespace change, and many
other stuffs that may cause the code to brake or not work entirely.<br/>
**This project is not ready!!!**

## Installation

```bash
composer require remcodex/client
```

## Usage

The following request will be encoded to json and send it to [RCE Server](https://github.com/remcodex/server#simple-server)
, the server will then decode the request and execute it and return the response to client.

```php
use Guzwrap\Wrapper\Form;
use Guzwrap\UserAgent;
use Remcodex\Client\Http\Request;

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$response = Request::create()
    ->post(function (Form $form){
        $form->action('http://localhost:8000');
        $form->method('post');
        $form->field('name', 'Ahmard');
        $form->field('time', date('H:i:s'));
    })
    ->userAgent(UserAgent::OPERA)
    ->withSharedCookie()
    ->debug()
    ->execute();

var_dump($response->getSuccess()->getData());
```

Start server
```bash
php server.php
```

    ->remoteAddress('http://localhost:9000')
    ->get('http://localhost:8000')
    ->exec();
```
